## iOS How to build a Table View with multiple cell types (cleaner way)

In this project I'm gonna improve code base of a article has been posted on Medium. You can checkout the article here:
https://medium.com/@stasost/ios-how-to-build-a-table-view-with-multiple-cell-types-2df91a206429

The main reason why I want to do this because I've met a lot developers who always consider the solution they found on the internet as a silver bullet for their problem so they never intended to improve it. So I want to demonstrate even that article has been reached total more than 6.4k claps we still can do something better.
